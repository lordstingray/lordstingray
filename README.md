With over 5 years of experience as a software engineer with designing and developing websites using Ruby on Rails. Working in large development teams has sharpen my skills to adjust according to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables. I am also attentive to the need for continued process improvements and building quality systems that surpass end users' expectations.

Some other platform which are part of my professional experience for performance oriented web applications includes Postgres, New relic, Rollbar, Heroku, AWS services, cloud flare, Code Ship and Digital ocean.

For sure there is always some project management tool that helps you keep track of different development cycles and processes. For me recently, I have been working with Jira, but I have also used Trello and Asana. Also have very limited experience on Figma.
 
I am continously working on different support or developing tasks to horn my sklls, which is very tough quiet frankly, considering fast pace development and companies adopting new methods and technologies. There is always something new to work on.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about continous integrations, React, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

Well, Thats pretty much all I can think of about me. If you have any queries, feel free to get in touch with me 👍
