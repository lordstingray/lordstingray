With over 5 years of experience as a software engineer with designing and developing websites using Ruby on Rails. Working with diversed development teams has sharpen my skills to adjust according to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables. I am also attentive to the need for continued process improvements and building quality systems that surpass end user's expectations.

Some other platform which are part of my professional experience for performance oriented web applications includes Postgres, New relic, Rollbar, Datadog, Sentry, Heroku, AWS services, Cloud flare, Code ship and Digital ocean.

Project management tools: I have been working with Jira, but I have also used Trello and Asana. Also have very moderate experience with Figma.
 
I am continously working on different support or developing tasks to horn my sklls. Developing companies are always adopting new standards and keep updaitng technology stacks causes space to always work on something new.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about continous integrations, React, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.
